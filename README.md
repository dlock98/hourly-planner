# Hourly Planner
A simple calendar app for scheduling your work day. Add or delete your tasks in the desired time slot and click save.

## Description
I made this project utilizing a third-party API. Moment.js was chosen to get the current date and format time. I used Jquery to build out the html page through code and JSON to store the users daily tasks locally. When the page loads it displays time slots 9am-5pm and the user is able to type in their tasks and then same them.
